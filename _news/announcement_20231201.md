Back in 2022, I was honored to receive my first nomination for the <a href="https://dairawards.com">DAIR Awards</a>, a great program celebrating individuals and organizations driving innovation in Data and AI. This recognition was a powerful motivator, inspiring me to delve deeper into emerging AI concepts and engage more actively with the broader community.

My 2022 journey was also marked by a special milestone: being awarded a spot on the <a href="https://hyperight.com/nordic100">Hyperight Nordic 100 list</a>. This recognition celebrates the top data, analytics, and AI innovators in the Nordic region. It was thrilling to be in the company of such remarkable professionals who continually push boundaries in machine learning, data management, and AI-driven solutions.
