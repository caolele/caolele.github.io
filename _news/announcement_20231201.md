Back in 2022, I was honored to receive my first nomination for the <a href="https://dairawards.com">DAIR Awards</a>, a great program celebrating individuals and organizations driving innovation in Data and AI. This recognition was a powerful motivator, inspiring me to delve deeper into emerging AI concepts and engage more actively with the broader community.

My 2022 journey was also marked by a special milestone: being awarded a spot on the <a href="https://hyperight.com/nordic100">Hyperight Nordic 100 list</a>. This recognition celebrates the top data, analytics, and AI innovators in the Nordic region. It was thrilling to be in the company of such remarkable professionals who continually push boundaries in machine learning, data management, and AI-driven solutions.

Looking back at these achievements from the vantage point of December 2023, I’m humbled by the opportunities I’ve had to engage with the broader AI community -- whether through conferences, industry collaborations, or knowledge-sharing platforms. The continuous support of friends, colleagues, and mentors has played a huge role in shaping my work, and I’m committed to paying it forward by mentoring and inspiring future innovators.

**Thank You**

I want to extend my gratitude to the DAIR Awards team for recognizing my contributions in both 2022 and 2023, as well as to Hyperight for including me in the Nordic 100.
