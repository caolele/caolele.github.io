I had the pleasure of joining <a href="https://www.0100conferences.com/conferences/0100-conference-mediterranean">the Zero One Hundred Conference</a> in Rome from Oct 17 till 21, where I spoke on a panel about "**The Rise of AI-Related Investments: How Machine Learning and AI Are Shaping the VC Landscape**." Alongside Mickaël Bellaïche (Redstone), Patrick Bartos (Reaction), and moderator Gianluca Dettori (Primo Capital), we discussed how AI could redefine venture capital decision-making, from deal sourcing to portfolio support.

It was a fascinating conversation about the opportunities and challenges AI brings to the investment landscape, especially concerning data-driven tools, talent, and the evolving role of AI in 2024. A big thank-you goes out to everyone who joined us live at the 0100 Conference Mediterranean -- the energy, questions, and insights from the audience truly enriched our session.

Prior to the event, I also had the chance to be interviewed by <a href="https://bebeez.eu/">BeBeez International</a>, where we explored Motherbrain, EQT’s AI-driven platform for analyzing millions of companies. If you’re curious about how we leverage large-scale data to inform investment decisions (and what’s in store for AI at EQT), check out the full interview <a href="https://bebeez.eu/2023/10/03/motherbrain-i-e-how-eqt-managed-to-analyze-50-mln-companies/">here</a>.

Overall, the conference was a great opportunity to connect with fellow AI enthusiasts, investors, and startup founders from around the globe. I look forward to continuing these discussions on how AI can transform and enhance our approach to venture capital and beyond.
