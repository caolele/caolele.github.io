I had the honor of giving a guest lecture at the <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en">Stockholm School of Economics (SSE)</a> as a part of the course "Digitization in Finance" course led by <a href="https://www.hhs.se/en/houseoffinance/about/people/people-container/ye-zhang/">Prof. Ye (Iris) Zhang</a>. The session focused on decoding AI's transformative role in entrepreneurial finance, drawing from my work at EQT Motherbrain.

During the lecture, I explored key applications of AI in private equity and venture capital, including topics of:

- Startup Success Prediction using deep learning models.
- Sector Prediction powered by large language models.
- Revenue Forecasting with classic and state-of-the-art methods.
- Deal Document Mining leveraging knowledge graphs for efficient analysis.

These topics showcased how we integrates data science and machine learning to support deal professionals in sourcing, evaluating, and managing investments. I also highlighted the importance of combining proprietary data and innovative algorithms to uncover new opportunities in high-growth sectors.

The engaging questions and interactions from the audience were truly energizing, reflecting their curiosity and passion for the field. As part of the session, I shared insights from our published research, which you can explore on <a href="https://motherbrain.ai/about">motherbrain.ai</a>, and made <a href="https://github.com/caolele/caolele.github.io/blob/main/assets/pdf/HHS-lecture.pdf">the lecture slides available here</a>.
