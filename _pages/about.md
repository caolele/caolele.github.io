I currently serve as a Senior Principal AI Researcher and Research Lead at `Microsoft (Activision Blizzard King)`. I earned my Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in collaboration with [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) in 2016.

With over 16 years of industry experience in `Private Equity`, `Gaming`, `Telecom`, and `E-commerce`, I have published in premier conferences such as ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, EMNLP, IJCAI and KDD, and regularly serve as a reviewer for these venues. I have supervised more than 10 Masterâ€™s students from institutions including [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en), [VU](https://vu.nl/en), [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html), [UU](https://www.uu.se/en), [LiU](https://liu.se/), and [USTC](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), and currently mentor industrial Ph.D. candidates.

My research focuses on self-supervised representation learning, graph learning, offline reinforcement learning, event streams, and time series modeling.
